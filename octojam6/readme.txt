Octojam submission:

Dump Trump
Press the 5 button to punch the president in his face.  Try to land him in
Mexico, a dumpster fire, or even into a pile of pooh.

I've only done one other Chip-8 game before, so this is my second game.  I also
wrote Floppy Bird (source). This was my first game using Octo and the XO
extensions

I tried briefly to add audio to the game, but I just made the screen blink so
much I would cause seizures.
